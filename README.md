# Enhancing-Sales-Strategy-of-e-Learning-Platforms-Using-ML
Final Year Project.

The project was focused on the real-life problem which is faced by various organisations that is finding the more interested user who is more likely to buy the product.
This process is called predictive scoring in B2C market and we created an automated system to rank users according to their activity. 
This system will help sales team to spent more time on the interested user rather than wasting their time on less interested users. 
That will lead to more conversion rate (from 30% to 70%)- (as data set was artificially created and balanced).  
The Dataset we used was available on Kaggle and has 9000 datapoints and 37 attributes. 
First, we pre-processed the data (data cleaning, feature scaling, categorical data) and run through exploratory data analysis which led to find the important and hidden insights from the data and removed some attributes based on recursive feature elimination. 
After that we used various classifier models such as logistic regression, KNN, SVM, random forest classifier and na√Øve bayes along with hyperparameter tuning. We got an accuracy of 92% and cross validated with the confusion matrix. 
We also to used recommender systems to recommend best course according to user need.  
That will lead to more conversion and also boost morale of sales team.
